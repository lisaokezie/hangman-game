# Hangman Game

Small code project inspired by [Code Kata Galgenm√§nnchen](https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/class-katas/galgenmaennchen/) to practice Clean Code principles.

This repository is also used to experiment with VCS features.

## Rules
A player thinks of a word and writes the first letter of it on a piece of paper. For each additional letter of the word, he draws a small line as a placeholder. The other player can now guess the individual letters of the word.
